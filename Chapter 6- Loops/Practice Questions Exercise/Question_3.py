#Write a Python program that uses a loop to find the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 100.
# Initialize a variable to store the sum
Total = 0
# Use a loop to add numbers from 1 to 100 to the sum
for number in range(1, 101):
    Total += number
# Print the sum
print("The sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is:", Total)

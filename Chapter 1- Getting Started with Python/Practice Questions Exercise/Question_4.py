#Compute the area of triangle
#Adding input so we can type in the number for 
#height and the base
Base = int(input("Enter the number for base: "))
Height = int(input("Enter the number fot height: "))
#Writing the formula of triangle
Area = (Base * Height) / 2
#Prinitng the answer
print("The area of triangle is ", Area)
